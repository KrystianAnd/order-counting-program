# 🧮 Furniture Fronts Calculator

**Furniture Fronts Calculator** is a simple desktop application built with **Python** and **Tkinter**. The program was made for my dad's company. It helps calculate the area and cost of furniture fronts, including additional pricing for edge handles and double-sided furniture fronts.

## 🚀 Features

- Calculate panel area based on width, length, and quantity
- Optionally include panel sides as "handles" (billed per meter)
- Support for double-sided furniture fronts (50% extra price per square meter)
- Input price per square meter and per meter of handle
- Automatically generates a summary with the total price
- Easy-to-use graphical interface (GUI)
